We love open source, collaboration and working with our community. We want to include players in our process so we started a few initiatives that will allow you to help on Particubes development.

Discover our whole Particubes documentation [here] (https://docs.particubes.com/).

In this documentation you will find:
- General how to start Particubes;
- Guides (still WIP);
- References that lists level objects to script in Particubes.

The best way to get answers to your questions is to join our [Discord] (https://discord.gg/NbpdAkv)! You will follow our adventures, interact directly with us and the community, drop feedback and see how invested our community and Voxowl team is in the game. Or just to say hi!
