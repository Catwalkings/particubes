Creating in Particubes is very easy! Our vision is to have a game that’s easy to use for creation AND play!

The game is changing quite often so it’s hard for us to create complete guides. That said, there are still useful and up-to-date resources that you can read at any moment [here] (https://docs.particubes.com/)!

### Why creating in Particubes?

Voxel building is a way to unleash your creativity. Build the items you have ever wanted to play in voxel games!

Then, any voxel enthusiast can start creating their own world or items! You can easily create worlds and items from the voxel editor app (download it for free [here]) (https://apple.co/3gM2hxA) that you can then import into Particubes. Build as many items, objects, structures and more stuff as you want!

You can also create items in the item editor of Particubes! You can preview the item directly on the avatar and change the point that will allow your avatar to hold it. New features are upcoming for this editor!

In the end, you will be able to **use your creations for your own mini-games**. You can generously **make these creations available to the community** so coders or game devs can implement your creations into their world or games.
