### Is Particubes going to be free to play or paid?

It’s going to be a free to play game with some limitations and premium perks. No limitations on the creation side though for artists and coders.

No. Online game servers are automatically created & managed by the Particubes platform as you need them when you join a game and/or invite friends.

### Will this game be online multiplayer ?
Yes, Particubes is multiplayer by default! As a developer, even if you don't write a single line of code, your Particubes game will act like a lobby/chat room!

### Does Particubes have an offline mode?
Not currently. We plan to make it possible to edit maps, items and avatars without a connection at some point.

### What age rating is Particubes?
We don’t have any official rating for the moment, but we consider our Particubes being an Everyone 10+ game.

We would be glad to help you on that, please contact us at [press@voxowl.com](mailto:press@voxowl.com)

## About the beta

### When does Particubes open its beta?
As soon as we are ready. We aimed at January 2021 but obviously missed that target... Mainly because of a bunch of unexpected technical issues. You will be warned about an opening date as soon as we are ready!

### Will all testers get access at the same time?
Not exactly. We first need to test how the game feels with a small amount of testers. Fix most important issues before letting more testers join the fun.

### Where can I register for the beta?
You can easily apply for the beta by registering your mail on our website homepage.

### Where can I download the beta?
At the beta’s opening, you will receive an email describing where and how you can download the beta, depending on the device you use.

### Where can I report a problem?
If you find a problem or a glitch in Particubes beta, please report it at [contact@particubes.com](mailto:contact@particubes.com)
If you are a Github addict, you can also submit an issue [here](https://github.com/voxowl/particubes/issues). 

## Block creations (maps, items, avatars)

### I have made wonderful creations on Minecrarft and Magicavoxel, will it be possible to import them in Particubes? 
We do actually use Magicavoxel a lot internally to design assets. We will soon add an import button within Particubes to import .vox files. 
As for Minecraft, you can use [this plugin](https://github.com/voxowl/minecraft-plugins/tree/master/plugins/mc2vox) on your Java server to export world portions into .vox files.

## Developers

### Is it possible to code my own Particubes game?

Indeed, you can build fun multiplayer games in just a few hours using the embedded code editor. You can also create your own items using the voxel editor, or use assets published by other artists in the community.

### What programming language does Particubes use?

In Particubes, games are written in [Lua](https://www.lua.org). It's very easy to learn, you can find tutorials and game sample codes on [docs.particubes.com](https://docs.particubes.com)

### What software should I use to program games for Particubes?

You don’t need to download extra software. Games can be created directly from within the all-in-one Particubes application.

### Is Particubes open-source?

We open-sourced a few components and will keep open-sourcing more along the way. You can check our public repositories on Github: [github.com/voxowl](https://github.com/voxowl). 

Most things that we use to build the application are still close source though currently.

### What engine does Particubes run on?

Our own inhouse engine, written in C/C++, and using [bgfx](https://github.com/bkaradzic/bgfx) for rendering.

### Is it possible to interact with external services?

There’s going to be a way to communicate with external services. We built this a while ago: https://github.com/docker/dockercraft. We want the same kind of things to be possible in Particubes.

### Any plans on porting to the web?

Yes, we decided to focus first on native applications for iOS, Android, Windows, Mac & Linux. Mainly because we want to get some visibility from the different app stores.

But then yes, we're going to support [Wasm](https://webassembly.org) as a build target to make it run within web browsers.
