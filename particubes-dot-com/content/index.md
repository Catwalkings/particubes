Particubes is a platform dedicated to **voxel games**, games made out of little cubes. 

Many different kinds of games for players. Magical tools for creative minds to produce & publish content (maps, items, avatars & code).

Particubes is **not released yet**. It will be available on **iOS**, **Android**, **Windows** and **Mac** devices.

Here's a quick presentation of what we have so far:
