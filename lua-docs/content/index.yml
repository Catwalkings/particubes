        In Particubes, all rules and behaviors in the games you play are scripted with a language called <a href="https://www.lua.org">Lua</a>.
    
        A default Lua script is generated when you create a new game. You can launch the game in debug mode and select `Edit code` in the pause menu to see it.

        By default, only the author of a game can access its code. But it's possible to allow other users to contribute. (more to come about this)

        Lua is easy to learn, don't worry if you've never used it. You'll be able to define custom things for your games in minutes. ☺️

        💡 Script comments start with `--`. Comments are not considered when running the script, they're only notes for developers.

    - title: "Quick example: How to jump higher?"

    - text: "Find where `Client.Action1` is defined in the default script:"

    - code: |
        -- function triggered when pressing the Action1 button
        Client.Action1 = function()
            -- Player represents the local player ingame avatar.
            -- Test if Player is on ground before changing velocity,
            -- otherwise, player could jump while in the air. :D
            if Player.IsOnGround then
                Player.Velocity.Y = 50
            end
        end

    - text: "Edit this line:"

    - code: "Player.Velocity.Y = 200 -- changed the value to jump higher"

    - text : >
        Use "Publish" button

        The game will restart for all connected players (including yourself), everyone will now jump higher. 🙂
