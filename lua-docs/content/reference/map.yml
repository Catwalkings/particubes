functions:

      description: |
          Adds a shape to the map.
      arguments:

          type: Shape
      samples:
        - code: |
            local shape = Shape(R.user.shape_name)
            Map.AddChild(shape)

    - name: "RemoveChild"
      description: |
          Removes a shape from the map.
      arguments:
        - name: shape
          type: Shape
      samples:
        - code: |
            Map.RemoveChild(shape)

    - name: "Set"
      description: |
          Function to define the world map. The map must be imported before the Set function.
          
          ⚠️ Currently, the map can only be set once, before the game starts. But it should be possible to load more than one map and set them dynamically in the future.

      samples:
        - code: |
            Import (
              "myUsername.myMap"
            )
            Map.Set(R.myUsername.myMap)
