# EventType

This is an enum (link to enum type) table containing the different event type.

Values are:
- PlayerArrived : triggered when a player has joined the server
- PlayerRemoved : triggered when a player has left the server 
- PlayerDied : triggered when a player died (TODO: remove this. Death will be a game-specific thing.)
- GameEvent : a custom game event
