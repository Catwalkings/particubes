    Inputs gives control over user inputs.

functions:
    - name: SetModePointer
      description: |
          Moving to "pointer mode" when called.

          [Pointer] callbacks start being triggered on mouse and touch events.

          User interface elements such as [Button]s become active.
      samples:
        - code: |
            Inputs:SetModePointer()

    - name: SetModeCamera
      description: |
          Moving to "camera mode" when called.

          Virtual game pads appear on touch screens. 

          Direction keys and gamepad start triggering [Client.DirectionDidChange](/reference/client#property-directiondidchange) callback.

          Action keys and gamepad start triggering [Client.Action1](/reference/client#property-action1), [Client.Action1Release](/reference/client#property-action1release), [Client.Action2](/reference/client#property-action2), etc.

          Mouse movements and touch drags now control camera rotation. (a function similar to [Client.DirectionDidChange](/reference/client#property-directiondidchange) will be exposed soon to provide more control over that kind of input)
