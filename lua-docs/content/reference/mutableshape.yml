type: "MutableShape"
extends: "Object"
description: A [MutableShape] is an [Object] that carries and displays a set of [Block]s. The difference with [Shape] is that [MutableShape] [Block]s can be modified.

constructors: 
  - description: "Creates a MutableShape with imported [Item]."
    arguments:
    - name: "item"
      type: "Item"
    samples:
      - code: local s = MutableShape(R.username.itemName)

properties:

    - name: "Anchor"
      type: "Number3"
      description: |
          Anchor is a point that you set as a way to specify what part of the [MutableShape] will be used when setting its [Position](/reference/shape#property-position).
      samples:
        - code: |
            -- Anchor at the center of the shape:
            myShape.Anchor = {0.5,0.5,0.5}

    - name: "Depth"
      type: "number"
      description: "Returns [This]'s depth, measured in cubes."

    - name: "Height"
      type: "number"
      description: "Returns [This]'s height, measured in cubes."

    - name: "Width"
      type: "number"
      description: "Returns [This]'s width, measured in cubes."

functions:
    - name: "AddBlock"
      description: |
          Adds a [Block] to the [This].
          
          Returns created [Block] (or [nil] if it fails).

      samples:
      - code: |
          local block = Block(1, 10, 10, 10)
          someMutableShape:AddBlock(block)

          -- AddBlock can also be called using
          -- block's palette index and coordinates:
          someMutableShape:AddBlock(1, 10, 10, 10)

          -- created block is returned:
          local newBlock = someMutableShape:AddBlock(1, 10, 10, 10)
          if newBlock ~= nil then
            -- block successfully created!

          local block = Block(1, 10, 10, 10)
          local newBlock = someMutableShape:AddBlock(block)
          -- Here `newBlock` is not the same as `block`
          -- they both have the same palette index and coordinates
          -- but `newBlock` has a parent shape while `block` doesn't.

    - name: "GetBlock"
      description: |
          Gets a [Block] from the [This]. 
          Returns [nil] if there is no [Block] at the given coordinates (i. e. if it's "air").

        - name: "X"
          type: "number"
