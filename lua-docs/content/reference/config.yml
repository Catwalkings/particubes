      Config holds the configuration for your game. The items it depends on, the map that should be used and other important things.

      You'll usually see it defined at the top of most game scripts.

  - code: |
      Config = {
        Items = {"aduermael.pumpkin", "aduermael.tomato"},
        Map = "gdevillele.pirate_ship"
      }

      -- also works this way:
      Config.Items = {"aduermael.pumpkin", "aduermael.tomato"}
      Config.Map = "gdevillele.pirate_ship"

properties:
    - name: "ConstantAcceleration"
      type: "Number3"
      description: |
          Acceleration applied to all physically simulated [Object]s in the scene. 

          By default, it represents the gravity.

      samples:
        - code: |
            -- turn off gravity:
            Config.ConstantAcceleration = {0, 0, 0}
            -- or
            Config.ConstantAcceleration.Y = 0
        - code: |
           -- turn off gravity for one Object only:
           myObject.Acceleration = -Config.ConstantAcceleration
           -- myObject's acceleration is now the invert of 
           -- Config.ConstantAcceleration, cancelling it.

    - name: "Items"
      type: "array"
      description: |
          A list of items ([string] references) that should be loaded.

          You'll be able to use thoses items to create [Shape]s, [MutableShape]s and other things.

          See [Items] for more details.

    - name: "MapPaletteOverrides"
      type: "table"
      description: |
          A collection of [Map] [Palette] indexes that you want to override in the game.

      samples:
       - code: |
          -- override Block properties at index 3 in map's palette
          Config.MapPaletteOverrides[3].Color = Color(255, 0, 0)
          Config.MapPaletteOverrides[3].Light = true
    # - name: "Gravity"
    #   type: "number"
    #   description: "Overrides default gravity if set."
