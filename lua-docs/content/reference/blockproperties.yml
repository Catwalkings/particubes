    `BlockProperties` describes possible properties for a [Block].

    In most cases, [BlockProperties] are `read-only`.

    Except entries `Config.MapPaletteOverrides`

    `Map.LocalPalette` can also be set 

properties:
    - name: "Color"
      type: "Color"
      description: |
          [Block]'s color.

          Note: if the color is non-opaque (`Color.Alpha < 1.0`) and/or light emissive, this property becomes read-only after game start.

    - name: "Emissive"
      type: "boolean"
      description: "Indicates if the [Block] is light emissive. Light color is tight to the color of the [Block]."

    - name: "ID"
      type: "number"
      description: "BlockProperties' index in the [Shape]'s BlockProperties array."
