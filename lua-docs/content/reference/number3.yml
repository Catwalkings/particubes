type: "Number3"
description: A Number3 contains 3 [number] values (X, Y & Z). It can represent different things in 3D space (points, vectors, forces).

constructors: 
  - description: "Creates a Number3 with values x, y and z."
    arguments:
    - name: "x"
      type: "number"
    - name: "y"
      type: "number"
    - name: "z"
      type: "number"
    samples:
      - code: |
          local myNumber3 = Number3(1, 2, 3)

properties:
  - name: "X"
    type: "number"
    description: "X value of the Number3."
    samples:
      - code: |
          myNumber3.X = 42
          print(myNumber3.X)
  - name: "Y"
    type: "number"
    description: "Y value of the Number3."
    samples:
      - code: |
          myNumber3.Y = 42
          print(myNumber3.Y)
  - name: "Z"
    type: "number"
    description: "Z value of the Number3."
    samples:
      - code: |
          myNumber3.Z = 42
          print(myNumber3.Z)

functions:
  - name: "Rotate"
    description: |
      Rotates the `Number3` using euler angles in parameters (in radians).
    arguments: 
      - name: "angles"
        type: "Number3"
    samples:
      - code: |
          local someNumber3 = Number3(0,0,1)
          local pi = 3.1415
          someNumber3:Rotate(Number3(0,pi,0))
          -- someNumber3 == Number3(0,0,-1), after a PI rotation around Y axis (180Â°)
