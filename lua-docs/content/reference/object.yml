type: "Object"
description: |
  An `Object` is the most basic thing that can be added to the game 3D scene.

  It has a position, a rotation and a scale and can contain child [Object]s, including [Object] extensions like [Shape].

  An object by itself does not render anything on screen, but it can contain [Shape]s and thus become a parent coordinate system for them.

  An `Object` can also take part to the physic simulation when setting [Object.Physics](#property-physics) to `true`.

constructors:
  - description: "Creates an Object."
    samples:
      - code: |
          local o = Object()
          Map:AddChild(o) -- adds o to the Map (top level object in the game scene)

properties:

    - name: "Acceleration"
      type: "Number3"
      description: |
          [This]'s continuous acceleration.

          Default value: `{0,0,0}`.

          ⚠️ `Acceleration` is [nil] and can't be set if [This].[Physics](#property-physics) is `false`.
      samples:
        - code: |
            -- Acceleration can be used to compensate gravity: 
            myObject.Acceleration = -Config.ConstantAcceleration
            -- myObject's acceleration is now the invert of 
            -- Config.ConstantAcceleration, cancelling it.

    - name: "Physics"
      type: "boolean"
      description: |
          Turns physic simulation on/off when set.

          ⚠️ When turned on, [This].[Velocity](#property-velocity) & [This].[Motion](#property-motion) are set to `{0,0,0}`.

    - name: "Position"
      type: "Number3"
      description: |
          Position of the [This] in the world.
      samples:
        - code: |
            local o = Object()
            -- places the object where the local player is
            o.Position = Player.Position

    - name: "IsOnGround"
      type: "boolean"
      read-only: true
      description: |
          `true` when the [This] is not falling.

          ⚠️ `IsOnGround` only makes sense when [This].Physics is `true`.

    - name: "IsHidden"
      type: "boolean"
      description: |
          Can be set to `true` for the [This] to be hidden.
          Nothing else changes, the [This] remains in the scene and it keeps being affected by the simulation (collisions, etc.).

    - name: "LocalPosition"
      type: "Number3"
      description: |
        Position of the [This] in its parent.
        In other words, `LocalPosition` refers to the position of the [This] relative to the `{0,0,0}` position of its parent.

    - name: "Rotation"
      type: "Number3"
      description: |
          Rotation of the [This] in the world (as seen on screen).

          While it usually works for simple operations (like `Rotation.X = Rotation.X + someAngle`), we advise you to use [Number3].[Rotate](/reference/number3#functions-rotate) to rotate an object around X, Y & Z axis.

          You can also set unit vectors like [This].[Up](#property-up), [This].[Right](#property-right) or [This].[Forward](#property-forward) to orient your object.
      samples:
        - code: |
            local o = Object()
            o.Rotation:Rotate({0, 2, 0})
            -- o rotated 2 radians arount Y axis

            -- another way to rotate the object:
            o.Forward = {0, 0, 1}
            o.Forward = Camera.Forward

    - name: "LocalRotation"
      type: "Number3"
      description: |
          Rotation of the [This] in its parent.

          Nested [Object] local rotations are combined to obtain the "world rotation" ([Object.Rotation](#property-rotation)), the [Object]'s final on-screen rotation.
    
    - name: "Velocity"
      type: "Number3"
      description: |
          Velocity of the [This] in world coordinates.

          ⚠️ `Velocity` is [nil] and can't be set if [This].[Physics](#property-physics) is `false`.
      samples:
        - code: |
            -- makes myObject jump:
            myObject.Velocity.Y = 100

    - name: "Motion"
      type: "Number3"
      description: |
          Be aware, this `Motion` property is a hack regarding laws of physics. (sorry Isaac)

          But it's very practical to move objects without worrying about forces at play.

          This is what's being used by default when you're moving around with your avatar (see [Client.DirectionalPad](/reference/client#property-directionalpad)). It's the reason why you can stop moving horizontally while in the air.

          Basically, `Motion` is a constant velocity that's added to [This].[Velocity](#property-velocity) each frame to obtain the final movement. ([This].[Velocity](#property-velocity) value is not impacted)

          `Motion` is expressed in world coordinates.

          ⚠️ `Motion` is [nil] and can't be set if [This].[Physics](#property-physics) is `false`.
      samples:
        - code: |
            local speed = 10
            myObject.Motion = Camera.Forward * speed
            -- myObject will move in the same direction the camera is currently facing.
            -- If the Camera rotates after this, it won't change where myObject is heading.

    - name: "LocalScale"
      type: "number"
      description: |
          Scale of the [Object], in its parent.

          Nested [Object] local scales are combined to obtain the "world scale" ([Object.Scale](#property-scale)), the [Object]'s final on-screen scale.
      samples:
        - code: |
            myObject.LocalScale = 2 -- the Object is now 2 times bigger
        - code: |
            topLevelObject.LocalScale = 2
            local o = Object()
            o.LocalScale = 0.5
            topLevelObject:AddChild(o) -- o becomes a child of topLevelObject
            -- o ends up being displayed with a scale of 1

    - name: "LossyScale"
      read-only: true
      type: "number"
      description: |
          Convenience property that attempts to match the actual world scale as much as it can.

    - name: "ChildrenCount"
      read-only: true
      type: "integer"
      description: "Returns number of child [Object]s."

    - name: "Up"
      type: "Number3"
      description: |
          `Up` is a unit vector (vector with a length of 1). It determines which direction is "up" for the [This].

          Setting it is a way to rotate the [This].

    - name: "Right"
      type: "Number3"
      description: |
          `Right` is a unit vector (vector with a length of 1). It determines which direction is "right" for the [This].

          Setting it is a way to rotate the [This].

    - name: "Forward"
      type: "Number3"
      description: |
          `Forward` is a unit vector (vector with a length of 1). It determines which direction is "forward" for the [This].

          Setting it is a way to rotate the [This].

    - name: "Left"
      type: "Number3"
      description: |
          `Left` is a unit vector (vector with a length of 1). It determines which direction is "left" for the [This].

          Setting it is a way to rotate the [This].

    - name: "Down"
      type: "Number3"
      description: |
          `Down` is a unit vector (vector with a length of 1). It determines which direction is "down" for the [This].

          Setting it is a way to rotate the [This].

    - name: "Backward"
      type: "Number3"
      description: |
          `Backward` is a unit vector (vector with a length of 1). It determines which direction is "backward" for the [This].

          Setting it is a way to rotate the [This].
