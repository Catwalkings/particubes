description: |
    The `Server` acts as a host and director for the game.

    For example, if your game requires a minimum amount of players, it's a good idea to use the [Server] to count and trigger game start.

properties:

    - name: "Tick"
      type: "function"
      description: |
          Executed ~30 times per second. Provides the elapsed time in seconds as parameter.
      samples:
        - code: |
            -- executed ~30 times per second on each user device
            Server.Tick = function(dt)
              print("elapsed:", dt, "seconds")
            end
