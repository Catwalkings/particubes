    Pointer allows to catch user pointer events. Mouse events or touch events depending on the device.

functions:
    - name: "Show"
      description: |
          [Pointer] callbacks start being triggered on mouse and touch events.

          User interface elements such as [Button]s become active.
      samples:
        - code: |
            Pointer:Show()
    - name: "Hide"
      description: |
          Virtual game pads appear on touch screens. 

          Direction keys and gamepad start triggering [Client.DirectionDidChange](/reference/client#property-directiondidchange) 

          The pointer is hidden by default.
      samples:
          - code: |
              Pointer:Hide()

properties:

    - name: "DidShow"
      type: function
      description: |
          Triggered when entering "pointer mode".
          Technically, no visual pointer does show on a touch screen, but it means the UI is now receiving pointer inputs. 
          When using a mouse, that function is triggered when the cursor becomes visible.
      samples:
        - code: |
            Pointer.DidShow = function()

            end

    - name: "DidHide"
      type: function
      description: |
          Triggered when leaving "pointer mode".
          Technically, no visual pointer disappears on a touch screen, but it means the UI now stops receiving pointer inputs.
          When using a mouse, that function is triggered when the cursor disappears.
      samples:
        - code: |
            Pointer.DidHide = function()

            end

    - name: "Down"
      type: function
      description: "Triggered when pressing the pointer. (left click or one finger touch down)"
      samples:
        - code: |
            Pointer.Down = function( pointerEvent )
              
            end

    - name: "Drag"
      type: function
      description: "Triggered when the pointer is dragged (moved while down)."
      samples:
        - code: |
            Pointer.Drag = function( pointerEvent )
                print(pointerEvent.DX, pointerEvent.DY)
            end

    - name: "Drag2"
      type: function
      description: "Triggered when the pointer is moved with right mouse button or 2 touch fingers down."
      samples:
        - code: |
            Pointer.Drag2 = function( pointerEvent )
                print(pointerEvent.DX, pointerEvent.DY)
            end

    - name: "Up"
      type: function
      description: "Triggered when the pointer is released."
      samples:
        - code: |
            Pointer.Up = function( pointerEvent )

            end

    - name: "Zoom"
      type: function
      description: "Triggered when scrolling with mouse or pinching in/out with 2 fingers."
      samples:
        - code: |
            Pointer.Zoom = function( pointerEvent )
