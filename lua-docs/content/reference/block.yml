type: "Block"
description: |
    A `Block` represents one block in a [Shape] or [MutableShape] (like the [Map]).

    A `Block` can be built with one of the [constructors](/reference/block#constructors), but it can also be obtained from a [Shape] or [MutableShape] with [Shape.GetBlock](/reference/shape#functions-getblock) or [MutableShape.GetBlock](/reference/mutableshape#functions-getblock).

    ⚠️ A `Block` obtained from an immutable object (like [Shape]) is in fact `read-only`, none of its properties can be set in that case.

constructors: 
  - description: |
      Creates a `Block` with `{0,0,0}` coordinates. ([Block.Position](#property-position))

      [Block.PaletteIndex](#property-paletteindex) is set to `paletteIndex`, but [Block.Properties](#property-properties) remains [nil] before the block is added to a [MutableShape] (owns the [Palette]).

    arguments:
    - name: "paletteIndex"
      type: "number"
  - description: |
      Creates a `Block` with `{x,y,z}` coordinates. ([Block.Position](#property-position))

      [Block.PaletteIndex](#property-paletteindex) is set to `paletteIndex`, but [Block.Properties](#property-properties) remains [nil] before the block is added to a [MutableShape] (owns the [Palette]).
    arguments:

      Creates a `Block` with `position` coordinates. ([Block.Position](#property-position))

      [Block.PaletteIndex](#property-paletteindex) is set to `paletteIndex`, but [Block.Properties](#property-properties) remains [nil] before the block is added to a [MutableShape] (owns the [Palette]).

properties:

      description: |
          Block's palette index. (first index is `1`)

          ⚠️ [Block.Properties](#property-properties) remains [nil] if the block does not belong to a [Shape] or [MutableShape] (instances owning a [Palette]).

functions:
    - name: "AddNeighbor"
      description: |
          Adds a `Block`, adjacent to the face passed as parameter.

          ⚠️ Won't work with `read-only` Blocks.
      arguments:
        - name: "block"
          type: "Block"
        - name: "face"

    - name: "Remove"
      description: |
          Removes the `Block` from its parent [MutableShape].

          ⚠️ Won't work with `read-only` Blocks.
      samples:
        - code: |
            -- remove block when Action2 is triggered
            Client.Action2 = function()
              -- cast a ray, see if it touches a block

              impact.Block:Remove()
            end

    - name: "Replace"
      blocks:
      description: |
          Replaces the `Block` with the one passed as parameter. The position remains the same, [Block.PaletteIndex](#property-paletteindex) is the only property being set.

          `block:Replace(otherBlock)` actually has the same effect as `block.PaletteIndex = otherBlock.PaletteIndex`

              impact.Block:Replace(Block(1)) -- make it a block with PaletteIndex == 1
