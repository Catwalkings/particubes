type: "Shape"
extends: "Object"
description: A [Shape] is an [Object] that carries and displays a set of [Block]s.

constructors: 
  - description: "Creates a Shape with imported [Item]."
    arguments:
    - name: "item"
      type: "Item"
    samples:
      - code: |
          local myShape = Shape(Items.someuser.someitem)
          myShape.Position = { Map.Width * 0.5, Map.Height, Map.Depth * 0.5 }
          Map:AddChild(myShape) -- adds created shape in the map

properties:

    - name: "Anchor"
      type: "Number3"
      description: |
          Anchor is a point that you set as a way to specify what part of the [Shape] will be used when setting its [Position](/reference/shape#property-position).
          A [Shape] rotates around this point given in block. The Anchor point can be outside your shape.
      samples:
        - code: |
            -- Anchor at the center of a 3x3x3 shape:
            myShape.Anchor = {1.5, 1.5, 1.5}

    - name: "Depth"
      type: "number"
      description: "Returns [This]'s depth, measured in cubes."

    - name: "Height"
      type: "number"
      description: "Returns [This]'s height, measured in cubes."

    - name: "Width"
      type: "number"
      description: "Returns [This]'s width, measured in cubes."

functions:
    - name: "GetBlock"
      description: |
          Gets a [Block] from the [Shape].
          Returned [Block] is read-only because [Shape] is immutable, unlike [MutableShape].
          Returns [nil] if there is no [Block] at those coordinates (i. e. if it's "air").

      arguments: 
        - name: "X"
          type: "number"
        - name: "Y"
          type: "number"
        - name: "Z"
          type: "number"
      return: 
        - type: "Block"
