creatable: true

blocks: 
  - text: |
      An event that's generated when using the [Pointer]. (see [Pointer].[Down](/reference/pointer#property-down) or [Pointer].[Up](/reference/pointer#property-up))

functions:
    - name: "CastRay"
      return: 
        - type: "Impact" 
      description: |
          Casts a ray from [PointerEvent] screen coordinates and returns an [Impact] (can be [nil]).

          The [Impact] contains information about the kind of thing that's been hit.
      samples:
        - code: |
            Pointer.Down = function( pointerEvent )
                local impact = pointerEvent:CastRay()
                if impact.Block ~= nil then
                  print("block hit:", impact.Block)
                end
            end
